#Joining the BCGov Organization#

The BCGov Organization on GitHub.com is the **only approved venue** for Open Source collaboration on Provence Of British Columbia files.

To get started as a BC Government employee or contractor on a BC Government Open Source Project, you will need to <a rel="join" href="https://github.com/join"> create a GitHub account</a> (ideally using your name (FirstnameLastname) but we're flexible on this one) **and** link the account to your "work" email. 

Already a GitHub user?? Then just link your "work" email to your GitHub account.

- You can have more than one email address associated with your account.
	-  For BCGov employees that's at least: @gov.bc.ca
	-  The GitHub profile does not need to contain any personal information beyond your name and perhaps your ‘company’. 
	-  For BCGov employees, let's use "Province of British Columbia" as the company.
- Then you will need to email the BCGov Org contact (see  the email link on the <a rel="home" href="https://github.com/bcgov"> BCGov Org Page</a>). Give your GitHub user name and ask to be added to the "read group" for the BCGov GitHub organization.

Once you are added to the BCGov Organization your membership defaults to "Private". That means that only other members of the BCGov org can see you there. If you want to make your membership known and shown on your profile, follow these <a rel="puborg" href="https://help.github.com/articles/publicizing-or-concealing-organization-membership/"> instructions</a>.
