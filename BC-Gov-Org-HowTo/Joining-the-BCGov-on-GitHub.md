## Joining the BCGov Organization

The [bcgov organization](https://github.com/bcgov) on GitHub.com is the **only approved venue** for Open Source collaboration on Province of British Columbia files.

To be granted permission to create or contribute to a repository in the bcgov org, you need to be invited. Ask an existing member to submit an Access Request on your behalf following [these instructions](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Getting-Started-on-the-DevOps-Platform/How-to-request-new-GitHub-user-access-or-repository-creation).

Once you are added to the bcgov organization, your membership defaults to "Private". That means that only other members of the bcgov org can see you there. If you want to make your membership known and shown on your profile, follow these <a rel="puborg" href="https://help.github.com/articles/publicizing-or-concealing-organization-membership/"> instructions</a>.
