## Creating and Deleting BCGov Repo's

Once you are part of the BCGov Organization you might just want to get going on making some stuff. To do that you'll need a Repository (Repo).

If you are creating an empty project on day one, you're on the "happy path." If you are looking to upload and open stuff that was already made by BC Government employees, contractors, vendors or friends you will have a bit more work to do. In **both** cases you will need to go through the Content Approval Checklist (link coming soon) before you can get started.

- First you will have to enable two-factor authentication for your GitHub account.
 - Two factor authentication can be achieved using mobile apps, SMS or a variety of desktop applications. There are excellent instructions <a rel="2FA" href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/"> here</a> to help you get that done.
- Then you will need to email the BCGov Org contact (see  the email link at the top of the <a rel="home" href="https://github.com/bcgov"> BCGov Org Page</a>) and ask to be added to an admin team for the BCGov GitHub organization.
- Now, when you create a new repo you need to select ‘BCGov’ as the owner (not your employee account).
	- Therefore, content added to the repo is ‘owned’ in GitHub terminology by BCGov, not the employee. 
- You will need to add the minimum content (License, Readme, and contributing files) to your repo before you get going on any project activities.

This process addresses legal concerns about content and security concerns about what would happen if an employee decides to close their GitHub account in the future. However, if an administrator deletes a repo in addition to closing their account, the repo itself and its contents are gone forever.

You will notice a log entry in the repo indicating who authored the repo (GitHubUserName authored 2 days ago). This simply indicates who created the repo, not ownership.
