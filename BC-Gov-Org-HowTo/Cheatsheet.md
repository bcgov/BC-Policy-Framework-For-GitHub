## "Working in github.com/bcgov" Cheatsheet

This github.com/bcgov Cheatsheet covers:

- a few things to help when you are just starting out
- things to touch base with *every time* you open or contribute to a code repository as a BC Government employee

All BC Government employees working in bcgov (or bcgov-c) GitHub should be familiar with the [**GitHub in the BC Government**] section of the BC Developer Guide(https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/bc-government-organizations-in-github/) 


### Joining github.com/bcgov
- Create a GitHub account and ensure your [work email is the primary or an alternative email associated with your account](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account)
- Enable [two-factor authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/) for your GitHub account
- Join the BCGov Organization: follow [these instructions](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/bc-government-organizations-in-github/#directions-to-sign-up-and-link-your-account-for-bcgov) 
- Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer


### Some Resources for Learning Git & GitHub
- [About Git and GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git)
- [Learn Git in 15 minutes](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
- [On-demand course in GitHub basics](https://skills.github.com)


### Creating a Repository (also called a "repo", basically a project)
-  Choose a path based on whether you are [publishing existing code, initiating a new repository or contributing to an outside repository](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/start-working-in-bcgov-github-organization/)
-  If you are publishing **existing code**, [evaluate the content to ensure there are no restrictions](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/start-working-in-bcgov-github-organization/#post-existing-code-or-projects) (e.g., Privacy, Copyright, Legal contractual or policy, Security) and confirm [authority to publish](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/license-your-github-repository/#authority-to-license)
-  If you are initiating a **new repository**, follow [GitHub instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/) and select 'BCGov' as the owner for all new repositories and implement the [required elements](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/start-working-in-bcgov-github-organization/#initiate-new-code-or-projects) of all bcgov repositories
- Pick a repository name that follows best practices, for example following a standard naming convention (e.g., using lowercase with dashes), using short and descriptive names with a prefix/suffix indicating technology stack, use case or team
- Ensure the repo contains the minimum required content (LICENSE, README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md files)
- Consider adding an About description and Topic tags to the repository details to make it easier for users to learn about the project
- Consider adding a [Project Lifecycle Badge](https://github.com/bcgov/repomountie/blob/master/doc/lifecycle-badges.md)


### ALL github.com/bcgov Repositories
- Every github.com/bcgov repo [must have 4 files](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/required-pages-for-github-repository/):
   1. LICENSE
   2. README.md
   3. CONTRIBUTING.md
   4. CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- [Sample templates](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Gov-Org-HowTo/README.md) are available for all of these 'must have' files


### How to License the Contents of a Repository
- Ensure [authority to LICENSE](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/license-your-github-repository/) the code and other non-code content in the repository
- Choose [a LICENSE](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/license-your-github-repository/#preferred-licenses) for your code (.md files are considered code). The default is the Apache 2.0 LICENSE
- Apply the Apache 2.0 LICENSE in 1-2-3 easy steps:
   1. Attach appropriate LICENSE file directly in the repository
   2. Add the boiler-plate Apache 2.0 LICENSE to the the bottom of your README.md
   3. Add the boiler-plate Apache 2.0 LICENSE to the comments header of _**every source code file**_ 
- Choose a license for any other content (e.g. docs, wikis and non-code stuff) &mdash;the default is [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)&mdash;and add to the footer of your README.md
- Repositories can have multiple licenses, for example if there is a mix of code and non-code or if the repo contains open datasets under more than one license

### Privacy, Security & Intellectual Property/Copyright
-  Before publishing any _existing code_ to GitHub, you must [evaluate the code to ensure there are no restrictions to posting the content to GitHub](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/evaluate-open-source-content/) (e.g., Privacy, Copyright, Legal contractual or policy, Security) by ensuring:
   1. The content is free of [Personal Information](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/information-management-technology/privacy) (Privacy)
   2. The content has been labelled 'Public' using the  [Information Security Classification Framework](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/information-management-technology/information-security/information-security-classification) (Security)
   3. The content is fully owned by the B.C. government and/or the B.C. government holds the [Intellectual Property and Copyright](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/policies-procedures/intellectual-property/intellectual-property-program) for the content
   4. There are no other legal, contractual or policy constraints
- Read more about assessing privacy, security and intellectual property in the [BC Developer Guide](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/evaluate-open-source-content/)


### Approval Requirements
-  [Approval for publishing to GitHub](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/start-working-in-bcgov-github-organization/) are from the deputy minister. Deputy ministers may choose to delegate this authority.
-  BC Government employees are responsible for adhering to any Ministry or project-specific approval processes for working in GitHub


### Appropriate Use 
- When youâ€™re consuming, sharing or contributing content to GitHub in your role as a government employee, you must adhere to the [BC Public Service Standards of Conduct](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/careers-myhr/managers-supervisors/employee-labour-relations/conditions-agreements/policy#standards)
- It is essential that [employees avoid any conflicts of interest when using GitHub](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Open-Source-Development-Employee-Guide/COI-Priv-IP.md), and personal use of GitHub must never be confused with professional use
- Make sure you're familiar with existing [OCIO policy on information security](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=BB7D7F3938634BF2973BDE1A899FB755) before downloading or testing any code
