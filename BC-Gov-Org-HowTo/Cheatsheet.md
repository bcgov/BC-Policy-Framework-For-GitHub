# Working in BC government GitHub environments "Cheatsheet"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The "Cheatsheet" document that was previously published here has been retired. The essential information from the cheatsheet has been updated and moved to the [B.C. government GitHub Quick Reference](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/use-github-in-bcgov/quick-reference/) within the [B.C. Developer Guide](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/) on [DevHub](https://developer.gov.bc.ca). This is a better location for the information, as other information related to GitHub in the B.C. government is being consolidated there.
