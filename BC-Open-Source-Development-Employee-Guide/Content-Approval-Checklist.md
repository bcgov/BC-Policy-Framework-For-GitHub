## Approval Requirements

Minimum content requirements, roles and responsibilities and the basic mechanics of working in GitHub are set out in the Open Development Standard [under construction].  The "Open Content Assessment Checklist" has been designed to help employees ensure there are no barriers to posting material on GitHub. If you are considering sharing code developed by or for the BC Government, you will need to complete this checklist and receive approval from your Deputy Minister (or delegate).
