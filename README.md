# BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub
BC Developers' Policy and Guidline Documents - All the information a BC Gvt employee could ever want about GitHub

***
The BCGov GitHub Organization represents an ongoing effort to enable public & private sector, as well as citizen developers, the ability to collaborate on, leverage and integrate technology assets outside of the typical government procurement/contract model.

This repo's content is focused on providing information, examples and guidelines to facilitate the creation and governance of BCGov Open Source projects. 

## Project Status
May 2015: We are at the discovery phase of the project and we are currently collecting material to form the content of this repository. Right now we are helping some early adopter projects get existing code up on GitHub. If are asking yourself "I wonder if my project code could be added to GitHub?" there is a great resource on OSS-Watch that walks you through an [openness rating checklist] (http://oss-watch.ac.uk/apps/openness/)

The framework work items that are actively being constructed are listed
