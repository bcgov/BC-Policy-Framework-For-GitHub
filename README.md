# BC government policy framework for using GitHub

This framework document is focused on providing information, examples and guidelines to facilitate the creation and governance of B.C. government open source projects. We don't want to duplicate the good work GitHub has done with their own [online guides](https://guides.github.com/). Our focus is giving B.C. government staff and contractors the information they need to get started on GitHub while remaining compliant with B.C. government's standards and policies.

In short, this framework document aims to provide all the information a BC government employee could ever want about [GitHub](https://github.com/bcgov). 

* If you are starting a brand-new project - you came to the right place! This document will get you going in the right direction.
* If are asking yourself "I wonder if my project code could be added to GitHub?" there is a great resource on OSS-Watch that walks you through an [openness rating checklist](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/apps/openness/).

## The `bcgov` GitHub organization

The [`bcgov` GitHub organization](https://github.com/bcgov) is an ongoing effort to enable public & private sector developers, as well as citizen developers, the ability to collaborate on, leverage and integrate technology assets outside the typical government procurement/contract model.

## Project Status (Historical)

Operational processes related to GitHub began to be developed at that time.
